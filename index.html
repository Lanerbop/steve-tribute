      <ul>
        <li><b>Millions of years ago</b> - steve was born. i think. he doesn't really talk about it much</li>
        <li><b>2012</b> - i found steve on the side of the round. i gave him the power of sight</li>
        <li><b>2012 (1 day later) </b>- i ran inside the house to grab a caprisun. when i came back, steve was gone. i thought i lost him forever</li>
        <li><b>2023</b> - after years of searching, i found steve. all those years ago, my dad grabbed him and put steve under one of the family couch's legs to level our extremely uneven couch. this whole time, steve was solemnly watching me grow up to be the man i am today</li>
        <li><b>2024</b>- i lost steve again</li>
